Questions:

1. in the revised roulette OOP, why is it better to have each subclass of bet create
its own "dummy" object for the factory to work with? Doesn't that take up 
a lot of memory? 

2. Organization: I don't want 20 subclasses of Expression cluttering up my model 
package. How to organize? Nested classes?

3. Expression currently has the .toString method, which forces me to keep a 
myValue and myCommand variable in that class (and thus in the subclasses). Any way 
to fix this?
