Tested with ParserTest, entered values by hand (running from Main) against images 
seen on assignment page: http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring12/cps108/assign/01_picassa/intrinsics/

Notes: I had to break the links to Expression.evaluate() inside the ParserTest class
in order to account for the variables x and y (the axes). 
This will have to be modified if ParserTest is updated to try the variables.

I coded at first without caring about the openness of the functions. As a result, 
Parser has commands like neg and color hard-coded in them. I'm sorry. I don't 
really know how to fix it.
