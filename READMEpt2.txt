Name: Wendy Yin wty3
Dates: Jan 28-
Time: I have no idea. Parts flow into each other. Maybe 3 hrs?
Estimated time: I have given up on estimating time. I just open up eclipse and follow whatever is on my todo list.

Consulted for part two:

my UTA
despair, fatigue

Tested with: running main, typing the given commands on site 
(http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring12/cps108/assign/01_picassa/part2.php) into it. 
Also modified the command * back to "mul" since we haven't mapped other strings to old 
commands yet.

Notes: 
Moved mySubExpressions into ParenExpression, default inside Expression is now "null" since Terminal expressions (numbers, variables) don't need that option.
